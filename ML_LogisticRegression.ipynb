Imbalanced datasets\n","\n","Imbalanced dataset is a problem because it can lead to biased models and inaccurate predictions. Here’s why:\n","\n","* Skewed Class Distribution: Imbalanced dataset occurs when one class (the minority class) is significantly underrepresented compared to another class (the majority class) in a classification problem. This can skew the model’s learning process because it may prioritize the majority class, leading to poor performance on the minority class.\n","* Biased Model Training: Machine learning models aim to minimize errors, often measured by metrics like accuracy. In imbalanced datasets, a model can achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class for all instances, ignoring the minority class completely. As a result, the model is biased towards the majority class and fails to capture patterns in the minority class accurately.\n","* Poor Generalization: Imbalanced data can result in models that generalize poorly to new, unseen data, especially for the minority class. Since the model hasn’t learned enough about the minority class due to its scarcity in the training data, it may struggle to make accurate predictions for instances belonging to that class in real-world scenarios.\n","* Costly Errors: In many real-world applications, misclassifying instances from the minority class can be more costly or have higher consequences than misclassifying instances from the majority class. Imbalanced data exacerbates this issue because the model tends to make more errors on the minority class, potentially leading to significant negative impacts.\n","* Evaluation Metrics Misleading: Traditional evaluation metrics like accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced datasets. For instance, a model achieving high accuracy may perform poorly on the minority class, which is often the class of interest. Using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) can provide a more nuanced understanding of the model’s performance across different classes."],"metadata":{"id":"VGkW-riWzvQm"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["sns.set_style('whitegrid')\n","sns.countplot(data=data6, x='annual_salary_bin', hue='annual_salary_bin', palette='pink',
